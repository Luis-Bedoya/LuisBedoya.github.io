                <p>
                    My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
                    City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding
                    of the use of arrays, for loops, and use of images. I created a program that displays an image in different shapes(circles and squares) and the brightness of the picture(black and white). The user can change the image clicking the mouse, in any part of the program. The size of the image will vary if the mouse is on the left or right. Furthermore, if the user press G, it would show up an Image and the user has to guess what is within 4 options.

                <p>
                    This is my project for java. This game call Rengaria is based on a discord server that I have with my friends. The game has many features such as save and load the game, mute, resume or increase/decrease the background music. Different sounds such as jump or when the main character takes damage. There are three levels, and each level has other requirements to move to the next level. Also, it has a lot of collision listeners that makes each enemy behaviour different.
